# Wavy
Wavy acquire signals from mic and saves as data (.csv) or exports as image (.png). Wavy has two graphic areas, which represents the real time data from mic (started when the software runs), and the recording area that starts when clicked on Record button. All saved data is relative from recorded area.

The recording area has three states: recording when the line is red, paused when the line is orange, and green when the recording was stopped.

Wavy automatically suggests the name for your data when is saved as the new_wavy_data_yymmddHHMMSS.ext.

# Dependencies

* Python >= 2.7 < 3
* PyQt4
* pyqtgraph
* numpy
* PyAudio (also PortAudio)

Notes: The easiest way to install all those things is: 
* Install Python 2.7 (or Anaconda/Miniconda that comes with numpy and other better libraries)
* Use pip install pyqtgraph (installs PyQt4 automatically)
* Use pip install numpy
* Use pip install pyaudio

For Windows users, PyAudio requires more things, the better way is to download the .exe installer from PyAudio website (that includes PortAudio) and install it. If you are using Anaconda or Miniconda, replace the 'pip' command for 'conda'.
